# üöÄ C# DevSecOps Pipeline

## Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline for a .NET/C# application**, showcasing practical integration of security and quality checks within the CI/CD workflow using **GitHub Actions**.

It automates:

* **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** with **SonarCloud**
* **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** with **Snyk**
* **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** with **OWASP ZAP**

The pipeline is designed to **shift security left**, ensuring vulnerabilities and code issues are detected early while maintaining developer velocity in a modern DevOps environment.

## Key Features

‚úÖ Automated **build and test** on push and PR events
‚úÖ **SonarCloud integration** for code quality and vulnerability detection (SAST)
‚úÖ **Snyk integration** for dependency vulnerability scanning (SCA)
‚úÖ **OWASP ZAP integration** for dynamic application scanning (DAST)
‚úÖ Modular, reusable **GitHub Actions workflow**
‚úÖ Practical reference for **DevSecOps in .NET ecosystems**

## Pipeline Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SAST - SonarCloud Analysis

* Runs on `windows-latest` for .NET build compatibility.
* Uses `dotnet-sonarscanner` to:

  * Analyse the codebase for vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells.
  * Enforce code quality gates before merging.
* Requires `SONAR_TOKEN` secret in GitHub.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ SCA - Snyk Dependency Scanning

* Uses `snyk/actions/dotnet` to scan for vulnerable dependencies.
* Provides vulnerability reports directly in the GitHub Actions output.
* Requires `SNYK_TOKEN` secret in GitHub.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ DAST - OWASP ZAP Baseline Scan

* Uses `zaproxy/action-baseline` to perform a baseline scan against a test target.
* Demonstrates dynamic scanning capabilities that can be adapted to real-world endpoints.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

‚úÖ GitHub repository with this project structure
‚úÖ GitHub Actions enabled
‚úÖ Secrets:

* `SONAR_TOKEN` for SonarCloud authentication.
* `SNYK_TOKEN` for Snyk authentication.

---

### Running the Pipeline

The workflow is triggered automatically:

* On **pushes to `master`**.
* On **Pull Requests (opened, synchronised, reopened)**.

You can monitor results under the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.

---

## Security Approach

‚úÖ **Shift-left security:** Vulnerabilities are detected early in the SDLC.
‚úÖ **Automated gates:** PRs can be blocked based on scan results if desired.
‚úÖ **Integrated scanning:** No manual intervention needed post-setup.
